Bonauto, Mary. Personal interview. 24 Dec. 2019.
Mary Bonauto is a Harvard professor and the Civil Rights Project Director at Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders since 1990. She was a lawyer involved in Baker v. State of Vermont, Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, and Obergefell v. Hodges, which all gave same-sex couples more rights in the US. In Obergefell v. Hodes, which legalized same-sex marriage in America, she referenced Loving v. Virginia, arguing that the legalization of interracial marriage is similar to same-sex marriage. By interviewing her, I was able to understand from a lawyers perspective how much of a precedent Loving v. Virginia set for future Supreme Court cases (such as the legalization of gay marriage).
